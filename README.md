Authors: Qing HAN, Chao YIN*, Yuan Liu, Yunyuan DENG, Peilin LIU

## Requirements

We recommend using python3 and a virtual env. 

```
virtualenv -p python3 .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you're done working on the project, deactivate the virtual environment with `deactivate`.

## Task

Given an image of a  Traditonal Style (TS) image, predict the correct style, e.g., Su, Jing style, etc..


## Download the CTS dataset

The dataset is hosted on onedrive, **download it [here (to be released soon)][xx]**.

## Train, evaluate and predict
